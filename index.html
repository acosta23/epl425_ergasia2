    <h1>Welcome to Grandma's Patisserie Website!</h1>
    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <h3> We are a small family-owned patisserie based in Nicosia. There are now 2 Real Patisserie shops, all independently 
	run and largely self sufficient. 
	We create luxury handmade cakes and pies with Grandma's recipes.
	While each shop has its own essence and character and is independently creative, ideas and recipes flow from one shop to another 
	and when perfected, go into our recipe book (not yet for sale) which is the ‘soul’ of Real Patisserie. 
	We bake everything as fresh as possible. The patisserie, cakes and pies baked in our shops are made 
	in kitchens open to view because we want you to be able to see what we make and how we make it.
	We have experience for more than 10 years! We want everyone to enjoy what we do so please get in touch if you have any special requests, contact with us! </h3>
